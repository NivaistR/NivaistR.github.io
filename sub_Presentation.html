```{r include=FALSE}
library('gapminder')
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
```


```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}

ggplot(
  subset(gapminder, continent != "Oceania"),
  aes(
    x = year,
    y = lifeExp,
    group = country,
    color = country
  )
) +
  geom_line(lwd = 1, show.legend = FALSE) + facet_wrap( ~ continent) +
  scale_color_manual(values = country_colors) +
  theme_bw() + theme(strip.text = element_text(size = rel(1.3)))

```
